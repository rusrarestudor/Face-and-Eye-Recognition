# Face-and-Eye-Recognition

The goal of this project is to design and implement a system for locating faces in digital images. These are in JPEG format only. Before we continue, we must differentiate between face recognition and face detection. They are not the same, but one depends on the other. In this case face recognition needs face detection for making an identification to “recognize” a face. I will only cover face detection.
